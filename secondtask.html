        <h2 id="header1" class="header">Biography</h2>
        <p> <em>Richard David James</em> (born 18 August 1971), better known as Aphex Twin and less prominently as AFX, is an Irish-born British musician, composer and DJ.
             He is best known for his idiosyncratic work in electronic styles such as techno, ambient, and jungle.
             Music journalists from publications including Mixmag, The New York Times, NME, Fact, Clash and The Guardian have called James one of the most influential or important artists in contemporary electronic music.
        </p>
        <p>Raised in Cornwall, James began DJing at free parties and clubs in the area in the late 1980s, and later at venues around the West Country.
             His debut EP, Analogue Bubblebath, was released in 1991 on Mighty Force Records. It brought James acclaim and a cult following; he began to perform at techno clubs and raves across the UK and continental Europe.James co-founded the independent label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephlex_Records"target='_blank'>Rephlex Records</a> the same year.
        </p>
        <h2 id="header2" class="header">Personal life</h2>
        <p> James has made "wild and essentially unverifiable claims" about his personal life in interviews, including the claim that he inherited the name of a dead older brother.
            He has described himself as "just some irritating, lying, ginger kid from Cornwall who should have been locked up in some youth detention centre. I just managed to escape and blag it into music.In a 1993 interview, he claimed to only sleep two to three hours per night.
            In the mid-1990s, James bought a disused bank in the Elephant & Castle area of London, where he claimed to live in a converted bank vault.
        </p>
        <p>He falsely claimed in a 2001 interview to have bought the steel structure in the centre of the Elephant Square roundabout, though this is in fact the Michael Faraday Memorial which houses an electricity substation for the London Underground. In the 1990s, James bought a 1950s armoured car, complete with a working machine gun, which he claimed to drive around Cornwall in lieu of a car.
        </p>
        <h2 id="header3" class="header">Career</h2>
        <p> In the late 1980s, James became involved in the Cornish free party scene, putting on raves at "secret coves along the coast and behind sand dunes".
            The first party he DJed at was in a barn in 1988.
            James started a regular DJ slot in 1989, playing alternate weeks at the Bowgie nightclub in Crantock. There he met Tom Middleton and Grant Wilson-Claridge.
            Impressed by James' music, Middleton played a tape James had given him to a free party organiser in Exeter, who eventually convinced James to release a record on his fledgling record label Mighty Force Records.
        </p>
        <p>James was initially resistant, but while he was tripping on acid backstage at a DJ gig, Darby and Middleton convinced him to release the record. Darby later said: "I think if he had not done that trip that night there may have never been any Aphex Twin." James has given a similar account: "...they made me sign the contract when I was off my face. I was tripping and they're waving this money and a pen at me. It's a bit clich√©d but it's the way they got me to sign.'Similarly impressed by James' music, Wilson-Claridge suggested they use some money he inherited to create a record label to release it.            He and James founded Rephlex Records in 1991.
